# Machine Learning From Scratch in C++

This repo acts as a learning project. I want to practice my C++ skills and also refresh my mathematical knowledge
on Machine Learning Algorithms.

I am  planning on developing couple of different Machine Learning Algorithms by writing clean code.

If you come across this repo you are free to suggest changes as this repo acts as a learning platform.

Maybe you can use this repo to learn and practice either Machine Learning or C++.

Don't know where this project leads, I might drop it after some time.
